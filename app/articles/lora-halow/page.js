          Understanding the Differences Between LoRaWAN and Wi-Fi HaLow
        </h1>

        {/* Introduction */}
        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
          In the rapidly evolving world of the Internet of Things (IoT), choosing the right wireless communication technology is crucial for the success of any project. Among the various options available, LoRaWAN and Wi-Fi HaLow are two prominent technologies designed to meet the unique needs of IoT applications. Despite their shared goal of enabling efficient communication for connected devices, they differ significantly in terms of technology, use cases, and performance characteristics. This article explores these differences.

        {/* Section: What is LoRaWAN? */}
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-[#d97706] mb-4">What is LoRaWAN?</h2>
        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
          LoRaWAN (Long Range Wide Area Network) is a low-power, long-range wireless communication protocol designed specifically for IoT networks. It operates in the unlicensed ISM (Industrial, Scientific, and Medical) bands, typically around 868 MHz in Europe and 915 MHz in North America.
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mb-6 text-gray-700">
          <li><strong>Long Range:</strong> LoRaWAN can cover distances up to 15 kilometres in rural areas and several kilometres in urban settings.</li>
          <li><strong>Low Power Consumption:</strong> LoRaWAN devices can operate on a single battery for years, making it ideal for remote and battery-powered applications.</li>
          <li><strong>Star Topology:</strong> LoRaWAN networks typically use a star-of-stars topology, where end devices communicate directly with gateways.</li>
          <li><strong>Data Rates:</strong> LoRaWAN supports low data rates ranging from 0.3 kbps to 50 kbps, which is suitable for applications that transmit small amounts of data infrequently.</li>
          <li><strong>Security:</strong> It incorporates AES-128 encryption to ensure data security and integrity.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-[#d97706] mb-4">Common Use Cases for LoRaWAN:</h3>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mb-6 text-gray-700">
          <li>Smart agriculture (soil moisture sensors, weather stations)</li>
          <li>Smart cities (smart street lighting, waste management)</li>
          <li>Environmental monitoring (air quality sensors, water quality sensors)</li>
          <li>Industrial IoT (asset tracking, predictive maintenance)</li>
        </ul>

        {/* Section: What is Wi-Fi HaLow? */}
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-[#d97706] mb-4">What is Wi-Fi HaLow?</h2>
        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
          Wi-Fi HaLow, or IEEE 802.11ah, is a Wi-Fi standard designed for low-power, long-range communication in the sub-1 GHz frequency bands. This standard extends Wi-Fi capabilities to IoT devices, offering better range and penetration through obstacles than traditional Wi-Fi.
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mb-6 text-gray-700">
          <li><strong>Sub-1 GHz Frequency Bands:</strong> Operates in the 900 MHz frequency range, enhancing range and penetration.</li>
          <li><strong>Low Power Consumption:</strong> Designed for IoT, HaLow devices consume less power than traditional Wi-Fi, suitable for battery-operated devices.</li>
          <li><strong>Extended Range:</strong> Wi-Fi HaLow can cover distances up to 1 kilometre, depending on the environment.</li>
          <li><strong>High Scalability:</strong> Supports many devices, making it suitable for dense IoT deployments.</li>
          <li><strong>Higher Data Rate:</strong> Offers data rates up to several Mbps, higher than LoRaWAN, making it suitable for applications requiring more bandwidth.</li>
        </ul>

        {/* Conclusion */}
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-[#d97706] mb-4">Conclusion</h2>
        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
          Both LoRaWAN and Wi-Fi HaLow offer unique advantages tailored to specific IoT applications. LoRaWAN excels in providing long-range and low-power communication for sparse data transmissions, making it perfect for wide-area networks and remote sensors. On the other hand, Wi-Fi HaLow bridges the gap between traditional Wi-Fi and low-power IoT needs, delivering better range and penetration while supporting higher data rates, suitable for more data-intensive applications within moderate ranges.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
          While Wi-Fi HaLow is promising, it is still in the early stages of adoption compared to LoRaWAN. As the technology matures, it is poised to become a significant player in the IoT landscape.
